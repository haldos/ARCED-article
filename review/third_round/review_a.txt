Reviewer A:

I think the paper scientific content is now ready.

Apart from that, I had some problems with an experiment (see below) and I
think the authors did not follow the reviewers advice to reread the paper.
There were numerous grammatical errors, as well as typos or presentation
problems, which could have been easily avoided and made this review very
painful.
I'll leave it to the editor to decide whether he prefers another revision or
move directly to editing.


****CODE
The code compiles fine, and "make test" also works. But when I run it with
"oranges.png" it fails (tried several parameters and both prewitt and
roberts). The problem seems to happen when reading the image

 ./edges input/oranges.png -p 0.2
A review of classic edge detection algorithms
Haldo Sponton & Juan Cardelino, IPOL 2014

Input image: 0.2
Size: 140655700885148 x 140733592255632

Number of algorithms to run: 1
Error: xmalloc: out of memory
Running Prewitt, threshold=0.20"

On the other hand, the image size is ok when I don't try to run any
algorithm:
 ./edges input/oranges.png
A review of classic edge detection algorithms
Haldo Sponton & Juan Cardelino, IPOL 2014

Input image: input/oranges.png
Size: 536 x 480

Number of algorithms to run: 0



Can you check it out?

****DEMO
Concerning my requirement for the demo, I was not asking for an archive of
all demo results, which would be meaningless, but for each experiment an
archive containing the results of  the different detections instead of
having to download each detection result separately.

*** PAPER

Algorithm 2 why not merge lines 7-8?

Then a list of errors (again). AGAIN I did not write all mistakes down, so I
strongly encourage you to proofread your paper.

abstract: results obtained from a qualitative point of view... -> rephrase
p1: "operations operations"
p1: two footnotes with the same url address.
p2: "a disconnected an unordered "???
p4:  a slight variation of [...] difference -> rephrase, no main verb in
that sentence.
p4: "their filter are" -> singular or plural?
p4: different thresholds lead to different results. Thicker... -> results:
thicker...
p5: [h!] in front of each figure.
p8: consists on convolving
p8 not only... BUT also
p24: "are arise"
p25: ".
p29: "results [...] algorithms our sample images." fig 20-21-22-23
