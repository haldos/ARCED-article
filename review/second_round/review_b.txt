Dear authors,

 

I took notice of your corrections. I must say that I have mixed feelings
about them. I will simply state my major sources of concerns here. Please
have a look at my annotated pdf for more details.

On the one hand you did improve the only troublesome theoretical part, that
was  the Haralick algorithm description. I believe you did a fine job in
this task, although there are still some minor issues (see annotations).

On the other hand, you did not take any account of the issues I raised
concerning the experimental part. I therefore recap the comments I made the
previous time here:

-  lack of in-depth study of the impact of parameters

-  lack of validation or challenging of the claims of original authors

-  poor explanation of the thickening observed in the Haralick case.

I am also concerned with a new issue of importance: It seems like with the
demo I get very different results  from the one presented in your text. The
difference are particularly obvious for the haralick filter. See my comment
in figure 15(f).

Furthermore, I am quite disappointed by your refusal to improve your
conclusion.

Best regards,
