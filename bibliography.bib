  Abstract                 = {{Gaussian filtering is one of the most successfully operation in computer vision in order to reduce noise, calculating the gradient intensity change or performing Laplacian or the second directional derivative of an image. However, it is well known that in a multi-resolution context, where the need for large filters is required, this technique suffers from the fact it is a computationally expensive since the number of operations per point in convolving an image with a Gaussian filter is directly ...}},
